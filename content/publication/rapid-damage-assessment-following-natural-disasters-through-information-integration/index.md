abstract: "A rapid damage assessment is essential for practitioners to make timely and informed decisions following a disaster. This research aims to provide such an assessment through integrating multisource information that comprises hazard characteristic, community exposure, community vulnerability, and social media information. To illustrate the reliability of the proposed strategy, supervised learning is employed as its performance highly relies on the quality of information integration. In detail, reference samples are prepared using the information of three recent hurricanes: Harvey, Irma, and Michael. Then, two supervised learning models—multiple linear regression and support vector regression—are trained using the reference samples from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The trained models are tested using the reference samples from hurricane Michael to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Theoretically, this research proves the concept of integrating multisource information for achieving a rapid damage assessment. Practically, this research proposes the whole pipeline from information collection to final prediction for deriving a rapid damage assessment following disasters."
