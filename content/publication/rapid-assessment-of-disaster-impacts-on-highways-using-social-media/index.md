abstract: A timely and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is
  desired for executing evacuations, providing emergency services, and planning
  relief and recovery activities in disaster management. Although social media—a
  near-real-time and human-centered information source—has been increasingly
  investigated to assess disaster impacts on communities, the employment of
  social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is still less explored
  due to the lack of a systematic and reliable approach. To fill this gap, this
  research presents a social media–based approach to assess disaster impacts on
  highways. Two social media–based indicators, namely, the number of
  impact-related tweets (NIT) and the geolocation of impact-related tweets
  (GIT), are designed to indicate the severity and location of disaster impacts
  on highways, respectively. Disaster impacts on highways during Hurricane
  Harvey in Houston were studied to demonstrate the developed approach. The
  feasibility and applicability of the research outcomes are validated through
  the highway high-water incidents data collected by the Texas Department of
  Transportation (TxDOT).
