abstract: "Public sentiment is a direct public-centric indicator for planning
  effective actions. Despite its importance, the systematic and reliable
  modeling of public sentiment remains untapped in previous studies. This
  research aims to develop a Bayesian-based approach for quantitative public
  sentiment modeling, which is capable of incorporating the inherent uncertainty
  of the interviewed dataset. This study comprises three steps: (1) quantifying
  prior sentiment information and new sentiment observations with Dirichlet
  distribution and multinomial distribution respectively; (2) deriving the
  posterior distribution of sentiment probabilities through incorporating the
  Dirichlet distribution and multinomial distribution via Bayesian inference;
  and (3) measuring public sentiment through aggregating sampled sets of
  sentiment probabilities with an application-based measure. A case study on
  Hurricane Harvey is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability
  of the proposed approach. The developed approach also has the potential for
  modeling all types of probability-based measures."
