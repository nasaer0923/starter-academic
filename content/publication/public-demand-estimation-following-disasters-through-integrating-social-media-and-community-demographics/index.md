abstract: "Following disasters, a timely and reliable estimation of public demands is essential to proper allocation of relief resources. However, such an estimation is challenging as public demands vary significantly in dynamic disaster environments. To address this challenge, this research aims to estimate public demands through integrating social media and community demographics. In detail, while social media is used to derive the percentage of the population with demands, community demographics are used to scale the demand percentage for estimating the absolute number of individuals with demands. A systematic research methodology is proposed to (1) eliminate the social media bias caused by behavioral differences amongst races/ethnicities and (2) include the sampling uncertainty of social media-derived demand percentage. Hurricane Irma-induced public food demands in Florida are estimated for demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of the approach. The research sheds light on the use of partial information for deriving insights into the entire population."
