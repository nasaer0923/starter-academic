abstract: Social media, a near-real-time information source, has been widely used to provide timely infrastructure-related insights following disasters. However, most previous social media-based studies have been solely focused on assessing infrastructure damage, which leads to a partial situational assessment lacking the other main types of infrastructure conditions, i.e., functioning, and restoration. To bridge this research gap, the present study aims to examine the use of social media for systematically sensing infrastructure conditions following disasters. An efficient topic modeling-based approach is proposed to (1) model infrastructure condition-related topics through incorporating domain knowledge into the Correlation Explanation and (2) achieve situational assessment through revealing the spatiotemporal patterns of topic engagement levels for the functioning, damage, and restoration conditions. To demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach, electricity infrastructure conditions in Florida following Hurricane Irma are studied. In addition to situational assessment, the proposed approach is capable of investigating the interactions between humans and infrastructure conditions, which benefits the understanding of human behavior during disasters.
