title: Social Media-based Public Opinion Reasoning on Society Reopening Amid
  COVID-19 in the United States
abstract: "A timely understanding of public opinions is essential for health policy makers to derive informed decisions amid COVID-19. This research aims to provide such a understanding by proposing two quantitative social media-based measures: the fraction of reopening-related tweets (FRT) and the net positive sentiment (NPS). FRT is designed to investigate the attention aspect of public opinions for indicating the level of the public involvement within society reopening. NPS is created to indicate the sentiment aspect of public opinions for revealing the level of publicâ€™s positive attitude about society reopening. A Bayesian-based approach is developed to incorporate the uncertainty of social media-based sentiment information. The proposed measures are expected to assist policy makers in understanding public opinions promptly, thereby deriving responsive society reopening policies. Despite that the proposed social media-based measures are illustrated with the context of COVID-19, they can be easily generalized to other crisis events with dynamic adverse impacts given proper social media data."
