abstract: Timely and reliable sensing of infrastructure conditions is critical
  in disaster management for planning effective infrastructure restorations.
  Social media, a near real-time information source, has been widely used in
  disaster domain for building timely situational awareness, such as urgent
  public needs and donations. However, the employment of social media for
  sensing conditions specific to electricity infrastructures has yet been
  explored. This study aims to address the research gap to sense electricity
  infrastructure conditions through mining public topics from social media. To
  achieve this purpose, we proposed a systematic and customized approach wherein
  (1) electricity-related social media data is extracted by the classifier
  developed based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
  (BERT); and (2) public topics are modeled with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
  to incorporate the formulaic expressions of infrastructure conditions in
  social media. Electricity infrastructures in Florida impacted by Hurricane
  Irma are studied for illustration and demonstration. Results show that the
  proposed approach is capable of sensing the temporal evolutions and geographic
  differences of electricity infrastructure conditions.
