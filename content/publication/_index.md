abstract: "During and after disasters, highways provide vital routes for
  emergency services, relief efforts, and evacuation activities. Thus, a timely
  and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is critical for
  decision-makers to quickly and effectively perform relief and recovery
  efforts. Recently, social media has increasingly been used in disaster
  management for obtaining a rapid, public-centric assessment of disaster
  impacts due to its near real-time, social, and informational characteristics.
  Although promising, the employment of social media for assessing disaster
  impacts on highways is still limited due to the inability of extracting
  accurate highway-related data from social media. To overcome this limitation,
  a systematic approach is proposed to identify highway-related data from social
  media for assessing disaster impacts on highways, and a case study of
  Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX, is employed for the demonstration. The
  approach is constructed through three steps: (1) building data sources for
  social media and highways of interest in Houston, respectively; (2) adapting
  the social media data to each highway through a developed mapping algorithm;
  (3) assessing disaster impacts through analyzing social media activities in
  terms of their intensity, geographic, and topic distributions. Results show
  that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the temporal patterns of
  disaster impacts on highways. Official news and reports are employed to
  validate the assessed impacts."
