Hello, my name is Yudi Chen. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Infrastructure Engineering, George Masson University. My research interest lies at the intersection amongst infrastructure resilience, network modeling, and big data analytics. It could be categorized into two interrelated areas: (1) Development of a data-driven decision support framework for assessing community vulnerability to natural hazards; and (2) Inclusion of human behavior to enhance infrastructure resilience from a social perspective.
