This research aims to investigate public opinions on society reopening through proposing two social media-based measures: the fraction of reopening-related tweets (FRT) and net positive sentiment (NPS). FRT is used to investigate the attention aspect of public opinions for indicating how actively involved with society reopening the public is, and population size differences are normalized to achieve a reliable comparison of public attention amongst the states in the United States. NPS is used to indicate the sentiment aspect of public opinions for revealing what positive attitude about society reopening the public has, and a Bayesian-based approach is developed to estimate the uncertainty of social media-based sentiment information. Results show that public attention in most urbanized states (e.g., California, Texas, New York, and Florida) is with the highest levels as social activities in these areas are severely affected by lockdown measures. Public sentiment is inversely correlated with the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, which indicates that the increase of COVID-19 cases makes the public reluctant to society reopening. The proposed social media-based measures hold the potential of assisting authorities in society reopening planning and could be generalized to other crisis events with dynamic adverse impacts.
