This research aims to achieve a rapid damage assessment following natural disasters through integrating multisource information that comprises hazard characteristics, community exposure, and community vulnerability. Supervised learning is employed for testing the damage assessment performance as its performance highly relies on the quality of information integration. In detail, reference samples are systematically prepared from the information sources on three hurricanes (i.e., Harvey, Irma, and Michael). Then, two supervised learning models—multiple linear regression and support vector regression—are strategically trained using the reference samples from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Once trained, the two models are tested using the reference samples from hurricane Michael. The model performance is comprehensively evaluated and the results prove that reliable damage prediction is achieved. This research demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of achieving a rapid damage assessment through integrating multisource information on hazard characteristics, community exposure, and community vulnerability. Also, the proposed data-driven approach can be easily generalized into a practical approach to perform rapid damage assessments for future disasters.
